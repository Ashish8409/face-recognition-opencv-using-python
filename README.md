Overview of Face Recognition
Face recognition involves identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or video frame by comparing it with a database of faces. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is widely used for real-time computer vision tasks.

Key Concepts
Face Detection: Identifying and locating faces within an image. This is typically done using Haar cascades or deep learning-based methods.

Face Recognition: Once a face is detected, it can be recognized or verified against known faces. This can be done using methods like Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or deep learning techniques.

Training and Prediction: The system is trained on a dataset of known faces and can predict or identify a new face based on that training.

Required Libraries
OpenCV: For image processing and face detection.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
face_recognition (optional): A Python library that simplifies the face recognition process using deep learning.
